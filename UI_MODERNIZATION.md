# Modern UI System - Sportify App

## Overview

The Sportify app has been completely modernized with a sophisticated design system that follows current UI/UX trends as of 2025. The new system includes:

- **Glassmorphic Design Elements**: Subtle transparency effects with backdrop blur
- **Neumorphic Components**: Soft, elevated surfaces with natural shadows
- **Dynamic Theme System**: Seamless light/dark mode switching with system preference support
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth animations and haptic feedback
- **Accessibility-First Approach**: Full WCAG compliance with proper contrast ratios
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for phones and tablets

## Key Features

### Usage Examples

#### Theme Hook
```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@/hooks/useTheme';

const { isDark, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
```

#### Responsive Design
```tsx
import { getAdaptiveLayout } from '@/utils/responsive';

const { isTablet, padding } = getAdaptiveLayout();
```

#### Animations
```tsx
import { createScaleAnimation } from '@/utils/animations';

const scaleAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;
const { pressIn, pressOut } = createScaleAnimation(scaleAnim);
```

## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
1. **Consistency**: Use design tokens for all spacing and colors
2. **Hierarchy**: Establish clear visual hierarchy with typography
3. **Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for all interactions
4. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Performance Optimization
1. **Native Driver**: Use for all transform and opacity animations
2. **Lazy Loading**: Implement for large lists and images
3. **Memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive components
4. **Bundle Size**: Tree-shake unused design tokens

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Light/dark theme switching
- [ ] Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility with screen reader
- [ ] Touch target sizes
- [ ] Animation performance
- [ ] Color contrast ratios

## Future Enhancements
