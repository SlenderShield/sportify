# Authentication Flow Testing Guide

## Overview
The app now has a complete authentication flow with onboarding for first-time users.

## Flow Scenarios

### 1. New User (Not Logged In)
- **Expected**: App shows login screen (`/auth/login`)
- **State**: `isAuthenticated: false, hasCompletedOnboarding: false`

### 2. First-Time Login
- **Expected**: After successful login, user sees onboarding screen (`/onboarding`)
- **State**: `isAuthenticated: true, hasCompletedOnboarding: false`
- **Actions Available**: Skip or Continue through onboarding slides

### 3. Returning User
- **Expected**: Direct access to dashboard (`/(tabs)`)
- **State**: `isAuthenticated: true, hasCompletedOnboarding: true`

## Testing the Flow

### Method 1: Manual Testing
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Open in your preferred simulator/browser
3. The app will initially show the login screen

### Method 2: Debug Controls (Development Only)
In the Settings tab, there are debug controls available:

1. **Reset Onboarding**: Forces onboarding to show on next app restart
2. **Clear All Auth Data**: Completely resets authentication state

### Method 3: Programmatic Testing
Access the store directly in development:
```javascript
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore';

// Clear all data
useAuthStore.getState().clearAll();

// Reset onboarding only
useAuthStore.getState().resetOnboarding();
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Authentication State Management
- Persistent storage using Zustand with custom storage adapter
- Auto-routing based on authentication state
- Loading states during initialization

### ✅ Onboarding Experience
- 4-slide interactive onboarding
- Skip and Continue options
- Progress indicators
- Smooth transitions

### ✅ Route Protection
- Root layout manages all routing logic
- Protected routes (tabs) only accessible when authenticated
- Automatic redirection based on state

### ✅ State Persistence
- Auth state persists across app restarts
- Onboarding completion tracked
- Graceful error handling for storage issues

```

## Development Notes

- The storage implementation uses in-memory storage for development
- For production, replace with `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Debug controls are only visible in `__DEV__` mode
